    <h1>Hello, I'm Brendan</h1>
    <!-- <img src="Images/utah_picture.jpg" alt="Picture of me in Utah" id="utah-picture"> -->
    <p>Welcome to my website! I am an incoming student in Georgia Tech's 
        <a href="https://qbios.gatech.edu/" id="gt-dark-link">Quantitative Biosciences (QBioS) PhD program</a>
        in the School of Mathematics.
    </p>
    
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        I completed a B.S. in Mathematics at the University of Central Florida (UCF) in May 2025, with a minor in computer science. I am generally interested in mathematical biology, differential equations, advanced calculus, and the connections between them. I have participated in two NSF-funded undergraduate research programs, with topics ranging from epidemiological modeling to bacterial population dynamics. See the <a href="/research.html" id="subpage-link">Research</a> page for more info on these projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        While I'm originally from Long Island, NY, I grew up in Jacksonville, FL. I spend my free time socializing, working out (swimming, weightlifting), and playing the piano. Recently, I also developed an interest in hiking and exploring new cities. I visited Bryce Canyon and Capitol Reef in 2024, and I went went on a road trip through Chattanooga, Asheville, and the Smoky Mountains in 2025.
